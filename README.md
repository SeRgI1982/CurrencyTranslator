# CurrencyTranslator

Task is quite simple, so I have decided to introduce an additional complexity - translate on:
- lost focus,
- property changed (not quite good from performance point of view),
- command
- command parameter,
- custom control.

Whole solution is prepared with the idea to extend it to the much more complex business solution (SOLID principles, TDD, Prism+Unity on the Client side, Unity on the Server side, n-Tier architecture).
